# Speedometer
An app that calculates speed in km/h and saves the records when exceeding the speed limit on a database

Speed Tracker App:
The Speed Tracker app is designed to help users track their speed and speed violations. This README provides instructions on how to use the app effectively.

Troubleshooting:
If the app asks for site permission, make sure you grant it for accurate speed tracking.

Usage:
Follow the steps below to set up and use the application.
1. Start the application
   Open the Speed Tracker app on your Android device.
2. Set the speed limit:
   Click the "Speed Limit" button to set your preferred speed limit. (Default speed limit is 50km/h).
3. Change the unit of measurement:
   Use the "Switch Mode" button, to switch between the speed measurement units (km/h and m/s).
4. Use the "Speed Record Viewer" button:
   Press the "View Records" button to access a list of recorded speeds. There are two options, "ALL RECORDS" and "LAST 7 DAYS" in order to view either all data or data from the last 7 days, respectively. (Data is only stored in the database when the speed is above the pre-set speed limit).
5. Start speed calculation:
   Press the "Start" button to start monitoring the speed.
6. Stop speed calculation:

Extra:

3. Phrase pronunciation:
   When the speed limit is exceeded, the phrase "You are exceeding the speed limit!" is uttered once. When the speed limit has been exceeded by 15 km/h, the phrase: "Your speed is 15 km/h above the limit!" is spoken once.
